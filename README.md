# EXPRESS TYPESCRIPT
* Before I begin the actual backend NextJS API, I want to make sure that I understand and able to develope my own server with Express using TypeScript.
* Just a standard Express implementation, where we will have server, routing, middleware and etc.
* Just checked it out on `package.json` or `npm install` to see the package what I've installed for this project.
